Copper Protocol :: Reliability Layer
 20kdc, 2017

The Copper Protocol as described in files 1 and 2 does not have any 
 semblance of application multiplexing or failure recovery.

This is intentional.
Assuming that nobody is trying to make the fatal mistake of constructing 
 a NAT, files 1 and 2 are enough for all routing-related purposes.

For applications, however, a protocol must be layered on top.

This document on the Reliability Layer describes how that should work.

All implementations of Copper that synthesize their own packets SHOULD 
 follow this protocol when doing so, unless they are a custom system 
 that will not be connected to any global network.

Firstly, note that, to the application, a Reliability Layer packet can 
 only be up to 1500 bytes precisely. This value does not change.

Secondly, note that an application should be able to ask to be notified 
 when a packet is received successfully or when the implementation gives up,
 with a flag indicating which is which.

Reliability Layer packets have a simple 7-byte header.
The first two bytes are the port number, in big-endian format.
The next three bytes are a number to this application-side packet.
They should be as random as possible.
The next byte is the 'attempt number' - the amount of attempts by this 
 side of the Reliability Layer "connection" to send a packet with this 
 meaning.

This can be achieved serially or otherwise, but should have a random base.
Combined with correctly-forgetting packet caches, this should prevent 
 any packets lost by data collision.

The final header byte is the actual indicator of what is in the packet.

There are two sections of packet types:

-- Basic Datagrams

0x00 indicates that this is an unreliable packet.
0x01 indicates that this is a reliable packet, expecting acknowledgement.
0x02 indicates that this is an acknowledgement for a reliable packet.
Other packets should be ignored as far as information is concerned,
 but as for routing-wise, not dropped.

An example scenario will now be presented:

1.

Alice sends a 0x01 reliable packet to Bob on port 8080,
 twice (the first attempt being dropped).
 1F 90 | F4 21 B9 | 00/01    | 01 | (...)
 port    packetID   Attempt    PT   Data

Bob receives it successfully on the second time, and sends back a 
 response, three times.
 1F 90 | F4 21 B9 | 00/01/02 | 02
 port    packetID   Attempt    PT

Alice receives the response and does not send a third packet.

-- Connections

0x03 : Request Connection Start
This is similar to an 0x01 reliable packet expecting acknowledgement in how it is to be sent,
 including the usual packetID randomization, and multiple attempts.
However, the data must be two bytes, and these first two bytes must be the new port number.
The port numbers that ought to be used for active connections are 0x8000 to 0xFFFF.
The response must be on that port number.

0x04 : Request Connection Start / Response
This is sent on the port given by a Request Connection Start to accept the connection.
It has the same format as 0x03 (new port number).
This establishes the connection, and data transmission can begin.
Connections die if no packets have been received by either side for at least 60 seconds.
It is recommended the connection "ping" every 15 seconds.

- The following packets have the current sequence number as their packetID.
  This variable is per-connection-side, starts at 0,
  and is incremented after a Connection Data packet
   sent by that side.

0x05 : Connection Data
If 0 bytes, this serves as a ping (not a packet)
The sender's sequence number is incremented by 1 before sending.
The reply is a Connection Acknowledgement with the same sequence number (but no data)

0x06 : Connection Resequencing
Specifies that the next data packet's sequence number is going to be 0.
(The packet has the current sequence number, to put it in context.)
It is this in particular which requires connections keep:
 1. A map of sequence number -> data (flushed when data is read)
 2. A list of sequence numbers to read.
When ready, a connection data acknowledgement should be given with sequence number 0.

0x07 : Connection Data Acknowledgement
Sent from the target of 0x05/0x06 to the sender. For 0x05, has the sequence number of the associated data.

ERRATA:

When this document was originally posted, the relib header was described as 6 bytes despite a total of 7 bytes being specified.
Thanks to @skyem123 for finding the issue.

The "Connections" section is a recent extension (August 28th 2017)
